Heyo! If you are reading this, that means you installed my MULTITOOL!! (or u're js galax and forgot how to code)

HELPFUL TIPS:
to create another option, copy;

echo [38;2;73;152;255m        ‚ï†‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê(4) idk(make it run anything)[0m  
echo [38;2;73;152;255m        ‚ïë[0m

to a new line on the options (not below the input thingy) and edit the values as needed!

idk what else to write here

if /I %input% EQU 4 start test.png
is to set up the input
change test.png to your desired file.

thx for reading <3

made with love
galax.
